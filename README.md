# Machine-Learning-using-Graphlab-Create

## About

The repository comprises of numerous ipython notebooks that shows the analysis of different datasets(which are too included in this repository) using different modules of graphlab create library of python( which is generally used for performing machine learning tasks ). Mostly, every ipython notebook contains a no. of solved assignment questions at last.

## Inspiration
The ipython notebooks present in this repository was created by me while I was doing the course 'Machine Learning Foundations: A Case Study Approach' on coursera.
